   # Replace below data inside python script; like developer key, password, etc. with that of yours. You will need to sign in(http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard) for YouTube developer key. Once signed in, register you product and get values for below attributes. 'source' and 'client_id'   will be the name of the product you registered before.

	Access http://localhost:3000. Try uploading a video now and once upload completes, you'll see url changed with some new parameters like status and id. Video URL would be: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<id>
